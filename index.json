Am I the person in the future happily building EC2 Instance and forgot on other AZ? then after month, you check your management console you have 100$ or more that needs to settle? am I the person in the future enjoys configuring VPC, route table and build IaaC? â€œ the answer still unknown but pretty sure, configuring and building are the things I love to do. Now, the journey starts. Research what AWS is. The cloud provider one not the shopping site. Then I realized, IT WAS BROAD than building computer that you just put hardware on computer chassis viola you have computer readily use. While researching, I found AWS Cloud Quest: Cloud Practitioner. Itâ€™s an interactive game that lets you do real world problem and uses AWS to resolve it. I tried it and enjoyed it. After I Passed the Cloud quest, I quickly jumped on Stephane Maarekâ€™s Course. Thatâ€™s the time that I need to do some deep learning as the course is all foundational and itâ€™s new to me. Yes itâ€™s difficult to understand at first. I also understand that there are two types of scaling. The instance type, whatâ€™s the importance of Cloud Adaption Framework, Well Architected Framework, Billings work and Security inside AWS works. And reading AWS whitepapers while watching Stephaneâ€™s course. This also includes hands on Simulearn.\nThen go on Tutorials Dojo to get their Practice Exam. The first time I tried to practice man it was devastating. I didnâ€™t even pass 20 / 65. then it progress while practicing. Checking where domain I am lack at then go at Stephaneâ€™s course to quick back on topic he discuss and read whitepaper. After weeks of repeating same step, I got 80â€“85% score on practice exam. Thatâ€™s the time I schedule my exam. I used Pearson Vue online as exam center is really far on our hometown.\nBefore the day of exam, I do more Practice exam and I passed it!.
